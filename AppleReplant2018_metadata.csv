"Treatments, including split plot variables:"
A = trees removed in fall 2017; fallow in 2018
B = trees removed in fall 2017; soybean cover in 2018
C = trees removed in fall 2017; black oats cover in 2018
"D = trees removed in fall 2017; oilseed radish cover, tilled under in 2018"
E = herbicide kill trees before removal in 2018
F = herbicide kill trees before removal followed by black oats cover in 2018
G = trees removed in fall 2018
L = old drive lane
T = old tree row

Notes:
Each 22' by 42' trt(A-G)/rep(1-6) plot crosses an old drive lane (L) and an old tree row (T) split lengthwise (new rows will be planted on 11 foot spacing).
2 composite samples (~10 cores each) were taken from each half (L or T) of the 42 plots for a total of 168 samples.
"84 samples were delivered to the Shade Lab to sieve, reserving enough soil for microbial analysis and sending the remainder to the Soil Testing Lab."
84 samples were delivered to the Quintanilla Lab for nematode analysis.
